# Project Overview

The spire/helm-chart effort intends to deliver a set of helm charts to
support SPIRE deployments in Kubernetes to the widest possible audience of
users.

## Mission and Scope

The mission of this effort is to provide a stable upstream repository
of Helm Charts sufficient for any organization or individual to use.

### What problem does this project address?

Prior to this effort, no single authoritative repository for SPIRE Helm
Charts existed, imposing an additional burden on SPIRE adoption as each
organization or individual had to develop their own Kubernetes
deployment packaging.

### What is the goal of this project?

The goal of this project is to be the primary means of deployment for
SPIRE into Kubernetes clusters, providing a flexible solution that can
be used in a wide number of different scenarios.

### What is the scope of this project?

The scope includes user documentation, chart creation, chart delivery,
chart testing, and chart maintenance of a set of Helm Charts sufficient
for deploying SPIRE in any SPIRE documented configuration, including
direction on how to extend the Charts to integrate non-SPIRE plugins.

### What development methodology is used?

An Open Source Development methodology is used, where issues are tracked
within the primary github repository.

## Status

The project is currently in a pre-release status.  While the standalone
deployment is close to release quality, the tiered deployment is not.
