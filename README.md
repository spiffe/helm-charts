A suite of [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/docs) for standardized installations of SPIRE components in Kubernetes environments.

## Add Helm repository

```bash
helm repo add spiffe https://spiffe.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
```

## Dependencies and Version Compatibility

Unless otherwise noted in an application chart README, the following dependencies will follow these prescribed version compatibility rules.

| Dependency | Supported Versions |
|:-----------|:-------------------|
| SPIRE      | `1.6.x`, `1.7.x`   |
| Helm       | `3.x`              |

> **Note**: For Kubernetes, we will officially support the last 3 versions as described in [k8s versioning](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions). Any version before the last 3 we will try to support as long it doesn't bring security issues or any big maintenance burden. *The first version we tested this chart with is `1.22`.*
