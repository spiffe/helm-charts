## Version support

> **Note**: This Chart is still in development and still subject to change the API (`values.yaml`).
> Until we reach a `1.0.0` version of the chart we can't guarantee backwards compatibility although
> we do aim for as much stability as possible.

| Dependency | Supported Versions |
|:-----------|:-------------------|
| SPIRE      | `1.5.3+`, `1.6.x`  |
| Tornjak    | `1.0.x`            |
| Helm       | `3.x`              |

## Prerequisites

This chart requires access to Tornjak Backend (`tornjakFrontend.apiServerURL`).
This URL needs to be reachable from your web browser and can therefore not be a cluster internal URL.

Obtain the URL for Tornjak APIs. If deployed in the same cluster, locally,
Tornjak APIs are typically available at `http://localhost:10000`.
Review Tornjak documentation for more details.

## Usage

Since this is just a demo version, to access Tornjak APIs you can use
port forwarding. See the chart NOTES output for more details.
